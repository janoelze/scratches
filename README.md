# scratches.sh

*__get in loser, we're ditching docker!__*

`scratches.sh` is a place for your web experiments. Think of it as a local version of codepen.io/JSFiddle or a pure CLI MAMP. It manages a simple directory of experiments (called scratches), registers hostnames in your /etc/hosts file and serves them locally through PHP's builtin server, resulting in an URL like hello-world.sketch:8080. In short: Just type `scratch new` in your terminal, give your scratch a name and `scratches.sh` will provide you with a directory where you can tinker just like you would on an Apache server.

__Why use `scratches.sh`?__
* Use the tools and IDE you know and trust â€” instead of a weird in-browser editor that tries to upsell you.
* Real files. On a real hard drive. Navigateable with a real file browser.
* Abstracts away repetitive setup for small web experiments.

## Dependencies

* PHP
